- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks and preferences are saved in local storage to persist between sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with modern structure and accessibility features.

- **LocalStorage API**: Client-side storage for persistent data.

## Design Philosophy

LifeCanvas was designed with these core principles:

1. **Innovation Over Convention**: Breaking from the traditional list format to explore more engaging visual patterns.
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Using size, color, and space to direct attention and organize information.
3. **Delight Through Details**: Micro-interactions and animations that create moments of satisfaction.
4. **Accessibility First**: Ensuring the interface is usable by all, regardless of device or ability.
5. **Performance Focus**: Lightweight code that runs smoothly even on lower-powered devices.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the LifeCanvas project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar55/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT/Basic\ Projects/1-to_do_list/
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the application.

4. **Customize the Application (Optional)**:
   - Modify the color scheme by updating CSS custom properties in the `:root` selector
   - Add additional features like task categories, priorities, or due dates
   - Extend the dashboard with more statistics or visualizations

## Implementation Highlights

### CSS Architecture
The CSS is structured using a component-based approach with custom properties for theming:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #6366f1;
  --primary-hover: #4f46e5;
  /* Additional color and style variables */
}
```

This makes the theme easily customizable and consistent throughout the application.

- State management for tasks, filters, and search
- Theme persistence across sessions
- Responsive layout adjustments
- Dynamic content rendering based on user interactions
